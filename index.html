                            <p>Uproot's concept has been through a serious journey of iterations and idea developments, however, the core purpose of this project has not been altered since the very beginning — addressing the value of animals in a contemporary society. Our group wanted to tackle how humans view animals as property instead of equals, how our society places infinite value on a human life yet disregard the same intrinsic right for animals and instead devalue it by focusing on their commercial and personal value. Philosophy of veganism and exploration of speciesism, prejudice in favour of the interests of members of one's own species, and anthropocentrism, regarding humankind as the central element of existence, have always been the central focus of this project.</p>

                            <p>As our group's initial focus was on challenging animal agriculture, we decided to concentrate on providing a sustainable alternative — an AUT community garden which would produce food for campus meals and ultimately undercut the university's dependence on animals products. This garden was meant not only for fresh produce but as a place for learning, developing healthy habits (Bremer, 2003, p.54) and building a stronger community spirit (Krasny & Saldivar-Tanaka, 2004) as well as many other social and economic benefits. The best way to proceed with this idea was to learn from an already functioning community garden which happened to hold lessons every week near the Civic Theater. Our group was able to get a great introduction to soil microbiology and what is needed to successfully run a garden. However, we realised that a traditional garden will not be able to even marginally supply the university with food so we started doing research into hydro, aero, aqua and fog-ponics as well as vertical gardening due to those methods being more efficient on all fronts: growing produce quickly while using less water and energy. We eventually combined those ideas together resulting into an automated vertical aeroponic garden growing spinach. </p>
                            
                            <p>Spinach was chosen due to a recent crop shortage due to extremely wet weather ("Spinach and salad", 2017) and we wanted to show that it is possible to have a steady supply of fresh produce all year round by using modern agricultural technology. The main challenge at this stage was not building a working prototype, it was pitching this idea to AUT, as university approval and funding would be needed. A few meetings and endless emails have resulted in nothing as AUT's representatives were not interested or not able to do anything to help. That was a breaking point in the project's development, the team's motivation drastically dropped as we revolved our idea's success around university approval, there was no way out but to change our means of getting the project out in the world.</p>
                            <p>Deciding to invest in ourselves rather than AUT was a decision that made the team excited about the project again — we were determined to turn it into a business. Being able to utilise our previous research about companies practicing unconventional farming methods was a great help but a few problems remained — funding and finding ways of distributing produce. For figuring out funding options we utilised every opportunity not wanting to rely on a single method in case of failure: contacted NZ's philanthropy society in hopes of an angel investor as well as relying on a crowdfunding campaign on Givealittle.co.nz. At this stage, we were simply trying to push our business venture Uproot out into the world as much as possible.</p>
                            <p>Our initial goal was to learn about animal and plant agriculture and then, as the project progressed, another goal was added — become competent in modern agricultural techniques such as aeroponics. I believe all of this and more has been achieved (albeit it could have been done more efficiently) apart from out main motivation behind the project — influencing the view of animals as products in society — that is a long term goal which can only be reached as Uproot becomes a properly functioning business, only then we will have the means of distributing knowledge efficiently to people who are able to make a difference.</p>

                            <p>Many government data sources are openly available, however they can be overwhelming and tricky to comprehend. flattie helps to bring this data in, and display it in the simplest way possible without compromising consumer usability. our rental data was supplied by the ministry of business, innovation and employment, who show the change of rental prices over time in different areas in new zealand in a csv file.</p>
                            <p>Flattie helps minimise the strain in the first stage of finding a place. after navigating to www.flattie.space, the user is presented with a map of auckland, and some brief information to start using the web app. hovering over a specific auckland suburb brings up a info bubble. clicking on it shows more information about the suburb, including quick links to trade me for that given suburb.</p>

                            <p>“SpotHype” is a web application for businesses and organisations interested in better understanding customer sentiment towards their products and services based on location. For example, businesses wanting to understand customer reactions to new product launches, marketing campaigns, and events.</p>
                            <p>“SpotHype” enables businesses to more accurately target their marketing based on location and user sentiment, enabling businesses to produce greater ROI from their limited marketing budget. Furthermore, using this solution they can measure the effect that their marketing has, and whether it positively affects user sentiment in targeted locations.</p>
                            <p>This app is a map of customer reactions through twitter and other social media. Using a colour-coded heat-map to represent sentiment (red being negative, green positive, and yellow neutral). Businesses can also track customer sentiment over time with a timeline by specifying a date range.</p>
                            <p>Tech used: Twitter API, Google Maps API, Stanford CoreNLP algorithm. Written in JavaScript with Node.js for back-end.</p>

                            <p>PodLink started as a touch screen kiosk redesign but went through multiple iterations until it was decided to focus on touch screen interfaces for use in transportation. To create a transparent and interactive display several technologies were investigated. Unfortunately the most relevant technologies, such as capacitive OLED displays are far out of reach in terms of its current technological state and price. A compromise, is to simulate this new technology using affordable and available resources. We decided upon an optical based touch screen, which is a similar technology to that which powers Microsoft’s Surface tabletop multitouch display using an array of 40 Infrared LEDs and an infrared camera, a users finger is tracked as it comes in contact with with a sheet of acrylic, creating an interactive multitouch surface. Behind the arylic is a transparent rear projection film which allows the display to remain transparent while being projected upon. We see this type of technology being implemented in bus stops windows, for displaying up to date bus routes and other relevant info.</p>
                            <p>The display uses 40 infrared LEDs, an infrared webcam, acrylic and image and finger blob processing software. Placed around 3 sides of the 10mm acrylic are the LEDs that face directly inwards. Frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) is the phenomenon in which light inside of media remains reflecting upon the media until the index of refraction of another object in contact, in this case a finger, is presented , allowing the light to reflect off of the finger which creates a blob of light under it. To accomplish this effect a relatively thick acrylic sheet was required, and LEDs were faced inwards and pressed against a finely polished acrylic edge to allow for maximum light penetration.</p>

                            <p>In The Design of Everyday Things (1998), Don Norman established the principle that good human-centric designs are intuitive. That is, the way an object is designed should tell you clearly what you are able to do with it. </p>
                            <p>The TELEPHONY is a project which seeks to take this fundamental intuitiveness and misdirect it. It examines the universally familiar design of the telephone and subverts its functionality, thus creating a disconnect between the user's expectations and the object's behaviour. Various responses to this are revealed, ranging from frustration to fascination, confusion to embarrassment. Ultimately we are encouraged to question the way we have come to understand everyday objects, and the inherently manipulative role of the designer.</p>
                            <p>The TELEPHONY is programmed with Arduino and the repurposed internal electronic components of a 1986 Telecom phone model.</p>
